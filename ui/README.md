# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Using AI Features

This application uses the Gemini API for its AI capabilities. To enable these features, you'll need to provide your own Gemini API key.

1.  **Get an API Key**: Obtain a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Set the Environment Variable**: Open the `.env` file in the root of this project and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with the key you obtained.

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

The application is now configured to use the AI features.
